# Face-Recognizer
Download this Project by clicking on the green button above that says "Code". Then Click on Download ZIP. Now unzip the file.

First of all open command prompt/terminal and type: pip install -r requirements.txt

Wait for it to load(2-3mins) then click on the unziped file then click on the file that says "Faces". Now **if you have only one pic of that specific face then** add the face directly to the Faces folder and name it the name you want it to be recognized by. But, **if you have many pics of the same face**(much much more accurate recognizing) then create a folder in the Faces folder and name it the name you want those faces to be recognized by.
now click on Face recognition.py and ***ENJOY!!!***
